  "about": {
    "intro": "Hello! My name is Lucky Bajaj. Yes, that's my real name. My parents thought let's give our child a name that wouldn't need a nickname.",
    "body": "I'm an IT Engineer by education and work in Product Management by profession. But really, I'm just an average guy from Mumbai — someone who's trying to keep up with the latest trends while being old-school at heart. I invest in cryptocurrency and pretend to know about them, and I'm starting a blog in the times of Instagram reels.",
    "outro": "In my free-time I cook, watch movies, nerd about the movies I watched, force people to watch those movies, and occasionally write here about things that nobody gives a bat about. And I wouldn't have it any other way.",
