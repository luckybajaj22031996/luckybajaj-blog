Hello! My name is Lucky Bajaj. Yes, that is my real name. Strange as it may sound, this is true. My parents thought lets give our child a name that wouldn't need a nickname. Enough about my name. I am an IT Engineer by education and a Business analyst by profession. No, it's not as fancy as it sounds. I am like an any other average Indian guy in their 20's. Someone who is trying to catch up with the latest trends but is also an old-school in their heart. (I invest in cryptocurrency and pretend to know about them and I am also starting a blog in the times of Instagram reels).

In my free-time I like to scroll Instagram and feel bad about myself. I also like to cook, watch videos of other people making delicious foods, watch movies , nerd about the movies I watched, force people to watch the movies I watched and so on. I like to have an opinion on social-media(not that anyone cares - it just helps me in staying updated).

There is nothing specific I am planning to post here. I always wanted to have a personal website of my own with my name as a domain so that I can come here occasionally and post things that nobody gives a bat shit about.
