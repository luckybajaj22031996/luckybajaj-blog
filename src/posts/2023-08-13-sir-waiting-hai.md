Ever visited your favourite food joint or a famous restaurant just to realise that there is a long waiting time or a huge queue to get inside the place and have the food. Moment you reach there is a person outside telling you "Sir waiting hai"!

Initially when this used to happen I just did not wait and walk away. I hated the idea of waiting to get the food. The size of the queues intimidated me. However, as soon as I gave it a shot once I realized that it's not that bad. Almost every time the waiting times used to be very less and the queues used to move faster than it seemed from outside. It all felt worth it.

The same is the case with life. Good things take time. You need to wait. They come to people who wait and atleast join the queue. Be it the things you want or the goals you want to achieve. Personal goals, professional goals or the Vada pav that you really like. It's all about getting in that line and the wait becomes worth it! We will never know until and unless we get in a line.
