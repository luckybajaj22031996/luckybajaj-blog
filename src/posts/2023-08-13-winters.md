you are like the winters. Mumbai winters!

you are not cold but pleasant.
you are comforting all around the day.
even in the afternoons that are otherwise hot, humid and unpleasant.

I am always in an anticipation to see you.

you give me a reason to dress up with all the coats and over-shirts which otherwise were resting in some corner of my wardrobe.

you are not harsh.
you don't make me sick.

you are like winters. Mumbai winters. just stay longer.
