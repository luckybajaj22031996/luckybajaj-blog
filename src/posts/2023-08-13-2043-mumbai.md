Lucky, a 27-year-old young man, finds himself lying on his bed awakening from his sleep. He looks towards the window and notices heavy rain pouring outside. Having moved to Mumbai about a year ago during the monsoons, waking up to this sight of heavy rain in July has become quite common for him. It seems that the city of Mumbai is in a perpetual state of rainfall, receiving it 24 hours a day.

As he gradually becomes more conscious, Lucky notices several differences in his surroundings. The ceiling above him appears extremely damp and distressed. A year ago, when he was struggling to find a house in Mumbai, he remembers being impressed and relieved when he finally found a place in a good condition. However, the room was remarkably small, with only a large bed, a wardrobe, a few pieces of furniture, and just enough space on either side of the bed for a single person to stand. What particularly caught his attention and sealed the deal was a box-like section on the right side of the bed, featuring a sitting area and a large window with sliding glass and mosquito nets. He remembers how that small little section is his favorite part of the house.

Looking to the right, towards the window while still lying down, he realizes that the windows can no longer be slid open. Instead, they are now covered by a single glass panel with no option for bypassing it. As his senses are heightened, he notices a musty smell permeating the room. While such a smell is common during the monsoons, its current intensity is significantly stronger and difficult to tolerate.

A wave of confusion washes over him as he contemplates these changes. He cannot remember any of this occurring. He struggles to recall if there was a disaster that led to these alterations. In his memory, he fell asleep in normal conditions, with walls and ceilings in good shape, and a pleasant scent in his room.

Summoning the courage to get up from the bed, Lucky notices something peculiar on the calendar placed on the tiny desk in front of him. Astonishingly, the year shown on the calendar is 2043. This revelation completely baffles him. He distinctly remembers living in the year 2023. After calming himself down, he starts making some fantasy theories in his mind, including the possibility of having time-traveled. He looks himself in the mirror and realizes that he has not aged a day; he looks exactly the same as he did in 2023.

Curiosity piqued, he peeks through the glass window and is greeted by a sight that leaves him utterly bewildered. The building opposite his own is completely submerged underwater. Recalling that it used to be a 10-floor structure while his apartment is located on the 15th floor, it becomes apparent that the city is submerged to the 10th floor level. Looking further downward, he observes mini submarines and a multitude of underwater tunnels. Everything is new and incredibly unfamiliar. The confusion and fear intensify as he grapples with the fact that he has no recollection of any of these changes.

Stepping out of his room, he discovers that the distressed and dampened state of the ceilings and walls is consistent throughout the house. The living room has been transformed into a storeroom, packed with countless packets of ready-to-eat food and water bottles. The entire house emanates an overpowering smell akin to a seaside fish market. Several cans of room fresheners are scattered about, which is entirely foreign to him.

Suddenly, the phone begins to ring. Despite his apprehension, Lucky musters the courage to answer it. The ringing persists, growing louder. He moves around the house in search of the phone, which he finds on the bedside table. Taking a deep breath, he picks up the call and anxiously asks, "Who is it?"

"Hi Lucky! Good morning," a voice from the other end greets him.

"Hi, good morning. Who is this?" Lucky responds, his tone still tinged with fear.

"This is Harshit. Are you alright? Your phone disconnected suddenly while we were talking on the phone last evening."

"What were we talking about?" Lucky inquires.

"Just general stuff. The last thing we were discussing was the prediction that Mumbai might completely drown by the year 2050 due to climate change," Harshit explains.

"I think it might happen sooner, perhaps by 2043," Lucky replies.
