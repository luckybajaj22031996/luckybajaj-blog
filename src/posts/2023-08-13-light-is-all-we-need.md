light is all we need

when the sky gets a little dark
when the mood gets a little gloomy
light is all we need

to take good photos
to feel a bit more energetic
light is all we need

when the nights get pitch dark
when we can't find our way and feel all lost
light is all we need

when hopes seems far away
in the moments both good and bad
light is all we need
