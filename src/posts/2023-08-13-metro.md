"Bhaiya dekhiye Metro shuru ho gaya hai" the auto wala says excitedly while pointing at a shining new metro which started operating just today!

"Isme jane ke liye token lagta hai na..hum sune hai" asks me with a child like yet a nervous energy. I say yes, and explained to him that it is not much different to the local trains that run and he should try taking a ride once!

"Paisa jyada toh nahi lagta na?" asks the driver. Natural for him to assume that shiny high tech looking stuff is costly. Without knowing the exact cost of the tickets since I didn't want to let him down, I reassure him that he should give it a go and that the tickets are not that expensive.

"6-7 mahine me pure Bambai me metro chalu ho jaega". It is pretty evident from his tone and expressions that how excited he is with all these new developments. But shortly after, he says, "Par isse auto ka dhanda kam ho jaega," in a very dejected manner. And we continue along that journey soaking in the contrasting realities of life!
